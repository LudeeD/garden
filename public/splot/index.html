<p>My girlfriend and I buy a lot of things.
Our usual flow would be: we go to the supermarket, we randomly decide who was going to pay that time, and then that person would ask the other for their half.
Sounds like a good plan, right?</p>
<p>However there were some issues with it, mostly originating due to my laziness.
The first issue would be that most of the time she was the one who paid.
Either I forgot my wallet, or my phone was dead. Sometimes it was even a combination of the two.
The second issue would be that when she asked for my half I sometimes did take a long time to pay back, the reasoning being the aforementioned tendency to have my phone without battery or just being a lazy person in general.</p>
<p>This was not ideal, since most of the time I would accrue a large amount of debt throughout the month, that would eventually be paid when my girlfriend lost her patience and finally demanded that I would pay her back.</p>

<p>From this situation Splot was born. Splot is supposed to be split with an O, because Oh my god I took a long time to pay my girlfriend back.
The idea was to build an application that would allow us to track our expenses in such a way, that instead of deciding randomly who would pay each time we could track who was behind in making payments, like a scale.</p>
<p>The benefits would be that we wouldn't need to constantly pay each other back and forth. We could strive to maintain a balanced scale, and there would also be a large record keeping the debt between us.</p>

<p>I was really happy with the end product, even more with the fact that we use it daily.
There is something immensely rewarding in building something for yourself, by yourself.
I am not really sure what it is, but I get a real kick out of it.</p>
<h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>
<p>The application itself was built with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>.
I like Svelte a lot, it does not feel as combersome to program as other frontend frameowrks.
One could say that I <em>react</em> better to their way of doing things.</p>
<p>For the backend I used <a href="https://pocketbase.io/">pocketbase</a> a all in one solution for my backend needs.
Authentication, tables, nice sdk that integrates well in the javascript workd.
Really pleasent experience.
Also in the future I would like to explore more this idea of a product that its bundled into 1 single binary.
Very powerfull stuff</p>
