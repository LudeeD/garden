    <h1>February product: Splot</h1>
    <p>My girlfriend and I buy a lot of things.
        Our usual flow would be: we go to the supermarket, we randomly decide who was going to pay that time, and then
        that person would ask the other for their half.
        Sounds like a good plan, right?</p>
    <p>However there were some issues with it, mostly originating due to my laziness.
        The first issue would be that most of the time she was the one who paid.
        Either I forgot my wallet, or my phone was dead. Sometimes it was even a combination of the two.
        The second issue would be that when she asked for my half I sometimes did take a long time to pay back, the
        reasoning being the aforementioned tendency to have my phone without battery or just being a lazy person in
        general.</p>
    <p>This was not ideal, since most of the time I would accrue a large amount of debt throughout the month, that would
        eventually be paid when my girlfriend lost her patience and finally demanded that I would pay her back.</p>

    <p>From this situation Splot was born. Splot is supposed to be split with an O, because Oh my god I took a long time
        to pay my girlfriend back.
        The idea was to build an application that would allow us to track our expenses in such a way, that instead of
        deciding randomly who would pay each time we could track who was behind in making payments, like a scale.</p>
    <p>The benefits would be that we wouldn't need to constantly pay each other back and forth. We could strive to
        maintain a balanced scale, and there would also be a large record keeping the debt between us.</p>

    <p>I was really happy with the end product, even more with the fact that we use it daily.
        There is something immensely rewarding in building something for yourself, by yourself.
        I am not really sure what it is, but I get a real kick out of it.</p>
    <h3>Technologies</h3>
    <p>The application itself was built with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>.
        I like Svelte a lot, it does not feel as combersome to program as other frontend frameowrks.
        One could say that I <em>react</em> better to their way of doing things.</p>
    <p>For the backend I used <a href="https://pocketbase.io/">pocketbase</a> a all in one solution for my backend
        needs.
        Authentication, tables, nice sdk that integrates well in the javascript workd.
        Really pleasent experience.
        Also in the future I would like to explore more this idea of a product that its bundled into 1 single binary.
        Very powerfull stuff</p>
