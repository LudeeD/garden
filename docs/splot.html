    <h1>February product: Splot</h1>
<p>My girlfriend and I buy a lot of things.
Our usual flow would be: we go to the supermarket, we randomly decide who was going to pay that time, and then that person would ask the other for their half.
Sounds like a good plan, right?</p>
<p>However there were some issues with it, mostly originating due to my laziness.
The first issue would be that most of the time she was the one who paid.
Either I forgot my wallet, or my phone was dead. Sometimes it was even a combination of the two.
The second issue would be that when she asked for my half I sometimes did take a long time to pay back, the reasoning being the aforementioned tendency to have my phone without battery or just being a lazy person in general.</p>
<p>This was not ideal, since most of the time I would accrue a large amount of debt throughout the month, that would eventually be paid when my girlfriend lost her patience and finally demanded that I would pay her back.</p>
<p>From this situation Splot was born. Splot is supposed to be split with an O, because Oh my god I took a long time to pay my girlfriend back. 
The idea was to build an application that would allow us to track our expenses in such a way, that instead of deciding randomly who would pay each time we could track who was behind in making payments, like a scale.</p>

<p>The benefits would be, that we wouldn't need to be always paying one another back and forward. We could try to keep the scale balanced, and also there would be a big shaming number remembering who was in debt to the other.</p>
